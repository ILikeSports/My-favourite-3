            <p>Tennis is a sport which is played with a raqket and a ball. Tennis is also my favourite sport as it includes unexpected twist and turns and is very unique.
            General Rules of Tennis
A ball must land within bounds for play to continue; if a player hits the ball outside of bounds, this results in the loss of the point for them.
Players/teams cannot touch the net or posts or cross onto the opponent's side.
Players/teams cannot carry the ball or catch it with the racquet.</p>
